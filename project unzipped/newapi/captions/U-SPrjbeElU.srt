1
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:08,340
I've only recently switched over to the

2
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:10,170
galaxy s 10 II as my primary Android

3
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:13,049
phone it's still a very fresh phone to

4
00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:15,030
me but last week the P 30 and the P 30

5
00:00:13,049 --> 00:00:17,250
Pro came out from hallway and I thought

6
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:18,990
I'd give them a run now just right off

7
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:21,930
the bat I have a strong preference for

8
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:24,570
the P 30 over the P 30 Pro there's just

9
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:26,430
a bunch of reasons I'll go through the

10
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:27,750
big one for me is size obviously if

11
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:30,240
you've seen my channel I like smaller

12
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:32,070
phones but it's also like the flat

13
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:34,170
screen I have mentioned before in the

14
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:35,160
past how it's Samsung's curved edges on

15
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:37,380
their phones it's not something that I

16
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:39,600
find particularly useful very beautiful

17
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:42,660
to look at but they're just like urgh

18
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:45,690
anomaly strange to me and the curve on

19
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:47,460
the the p30 pro it's even more

20
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:49,440
pronounced it's just not a comfortable

21
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:52,020
phone for me so I like the flat screen

22
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:53,610
of the p30 more than the pro and finally

23
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:55,860
it's the headphone jack I'm someone that

24
00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:57,030
still values the analogue headphone jack

25
00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:58,410
I feel like a lot of people don't care

26
00:00:57,030 --> 00:01:00,300
about it at this point but I just have a

27
00:00:58,410 --> 00:01:03,780
lot of regular headphones that I use and

28
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:05,790
I like the headphone jack okay camera

29
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:07,229
wise these are both fantastic cameras

30
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:10,950
for the people that are interested in

31
00:01:07,229 --> 00:01:13,500
the 50 times zoom on the p30 Pro it's a

32
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:15,840
cool feature but it borders on gimmicky

33
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:17,610
like there's just so little real world

34
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:18,570
use for it I feel like for most people I

35
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:20,490
know for myself

36
00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:21,930
I would never use that thing I would set

37
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:25,200
up like the first couple of days to see

38
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:27,720
how cool it is it's just it's cool but

39
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:28,680
it's you know you know what I'm talking

40
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:31,049
about alright

41
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:33,030
p30 however has a fantastic camera they

42
00:01:31,049 --> 00:01:34,920
both have fantastic cameras but the

43
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:36,990
night mode it's unbelievable it's

44
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:39,360
essentially night vision like it'll

45
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:42,030
capture usable images when it looks

46
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:43,560
completely dark to my eye it takes a few

47
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:46,049
seconds to capture the image like any

48
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:47,970
phone doing a dedicated night shot but

49
00:01:46,049 --> 00:01:50,430
it's honestly impressive and it produces

50
00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:52,560
better results than the competitors the

51
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:54,479
regular low-light photos so that's just

52
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:56,759
like auto mode in lower light but not

53
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:58,469
pitch-black those are also very good but

54
00:01:56,759 --> 00:02:00,509
I don't think it stands out as far ahead

55
00:01:58,469 --> 00:02:02,759
from the competition if anything I'd say

56
00:02:00,509 --> 00:02:04,409
that the pixel 3 has slightly cleaner

57
00:02:02,759 --> 00:02:06,149
photos when you're just doing auto mode

58
00:02:04,409 --> 00:02:08,129
but the p30 phones have excellent

59
00:02:06,149 --> 00:02:09,690
cameras all around one thing I did

60
00:02:08,129 --> 00:02:11,430
notice in terms of the camera it's not

61
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:13,830
where's camera for stills but for video

62
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:16,020
and you'll see it in other videos where

63
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:17,460
the image looks a little pink like

64
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:20,310
particular skin tones they just look

65
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:23,250
very red or pink and I just have like a

66
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:24,990
theory on that these phones were made by

67
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:26,400
qua way a Chinese company and I think

68
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:28,790
the majority of the people buying these

69
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:31,950
phones are gonna be from China and

70
00:02:28,790 --> 00:02:34,110
there's a thing about skin tone like so

71
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:35,790
I'm Asian I have Asian descent and I

72
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:38,190
have like yellowish skin and so when I

73
00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:39,600
shoot my videos I have to color correct

74
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:41,640
them in a way so that they have like

75
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:43,770
more of a pinkish hue to it so when I

76
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:46,710
look at my video footage from these

77
00:02:43,770 --> 00:02:48,630
cameras it looks Pinker than normal but

78
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:50,460
it looks good to me and it's maybe

79
00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:54,410
because of my skin tone I'm not entirely

80
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:56,820
sure but so I did a video with Lou from

81
00:02:54,410 --> 00:02:59,700
unbox therapy Wow must forgot channel

82
00:02:56,820 --> 00:03:01,380
name and on his set I look really yellow

83
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:02,970
like his skin looks normal but I look

84
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:04,350
like I'm from The Simpsons so I thought

85
00:03:02,970 --> 00:03:06,270
maybe it's possible that who always

86
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:08,250
using this kind of color tint or color

87
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:11,460
grading on their video footage to make

88
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:12,720
Asian people look more natural I'm not

89
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:14,520
entirely sure but I actually looked at

90
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:16,590
this video footage and I'm okay with it

91
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:18,180
now video is not this camera strong

92
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:21,239
point it's definitely stills like it's

93
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:23,280
phenomenal for stills but just thrown

94
00:03:21,239 --> 00:03:26,160
that theory out there Oh

95
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:27,540
fingerprint sensor I don't like the

96
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:30,360
optical fingerprint sensor on these

97
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:32,370
phones I prefer the ultrasonic on

98
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:34,320
Samsung's phones and actually prefer

99
00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:35,970
capacitive sensors over any of these in

100
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:38,430
display sensors but I definitely prefer

101
00:03:35,970 --> 00:03:41,370
the ultrasonic on the Samsung over the

102
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:44,280
optical on the p30s software-wise

103
00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:45,420
I don't love emui it's been like this

104
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:47,040
every year there's just something about

105
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:50,160
the software that feels a little bit

106
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:51,540
glitchy a little bit unrefined it's

107
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:53,340
something that maybe people love but I

108
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:55,110
just use this thing for a few days and I

109
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:57,360
immediately remind myself of why I don't

110
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:59,220
love EMU i but you can always throw a

111
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:01,430
skin on this thing the speaker quality

112
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:04,110
on the p30 phones are also surprisingly

113
00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:05,250
mediocre they sound very muffled I'm not

114
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:07,320
sure if it's on that they can fix with

115
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:09,360
software but both of these phones

116
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:10,860
I remember the p20 Pro from last year

117
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:12,420
had better sounding speakers in both

118
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:14,220
these that's just my memory of it these

119
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:15,810
sound quite muted and they also don't

120
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:17,609
have stereo speakers like the s10

121
00:04:15,810 --> 00:04:19,019
devices have also if you're from the US

122
00:04:17,609 --> 00:04:20,910
and you want to purchase this thing

123
00:04:19,019 --> 00:04:22,830
overseas understand that there's

124
00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:24,570
probably no warranty if you're from the

125
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:27,000
US because these things are not allowed

126
00:04:24,570 --> 00:04:27,780
to be sold there now the reason why I

127
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,420
made this video

128
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:31,770
kind of to help people decide between

129
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:34,860
the two phones like if you're gonna get

130
00:04:31,770 --> 00:04:37,410
a s10 or like one of the galaxy s 10 or

131
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:39,600
s10 a or s10 plus devices or one of

132
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:42,419
these new P 30 devices now on paper

133
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:43,919
these phones are like they're amazing

134
00:04:42,419 --> 00:04:46,470
they're similarly priced but the huawei

135
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:48,450
phones because it has such an amazing

136
00:04:46,470 --> 00:04:50,520
camera it would seem that this would be

137
00:04:48,450 --> 00:04:52,169
the phone to get but there's something

138
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:53,880
about the galaxy phones this year that

139
00:04:52,169 --> 00:04:56,130
just make them feel like a better phone

140
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:57,660
overall maybe I like the OLED punch out

141
00:04:56,130 --> 00:04:58,830
on the screen better maybe I like the

142
00:04:57,660 --> 00:05:00,390
software a little bit better it's a

143
00:04:58,830 --> 00:05:02,250
little bit more refined than the emui

144
00:05:00,390 --> 00:05:05,310
version that we're getting on the p30

145
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:07,560
phones I don't know they're great on

146
00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:10,110
paper those cameras are crazy good but I

147
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:11,940
still have preference for the s10 so I

148
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:13,230
guess the takeaway here is if you're

149
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:14,820
interested in one of these phones either

150
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:16,530
the Samsung phones or the koala way

151
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:18,210
phones take a look at the feature that

152
00:05:16,530 --> 00:05:19,400
you're drawn to and think is it

153
00:05:18,210 --> 00:05:22,140
something I would use regularly

154
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:25,370
frequently or is it something that a

155
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:25,370
company is trying to sell me
