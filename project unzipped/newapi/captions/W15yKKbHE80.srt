1
00:00:03,455 --> 00:00:06,255
In front of are arguably the best

2
00:00:06,255 --> 00:00:09,125
13 inch Windows laptops on the market right now

3
00:00:09,125 --> 00:00:11,300
This is the Huawei Matebook 13

4
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:12,660
this is the Matebook X pro

5
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:15,620
both kind of refreshed and brand new for 2019

6
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:16,400
Now

7
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:18,840
it's easy to kind of dismiss the brand

8
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:21,080
because some people said in the comments

9
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:21,940
to look at these devices and

10
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:23,460
they look like Macbook clones.

11
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:26,500
It's clearly look like they've been inspired by Apple's designs

12
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:29,860
and Huawei is a company that has a bit of a controversial past

13
00:00:29,860 --> 00:00:31,820
they've been caught for

14
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:33,820
IP theft, and patent infringement,

15
00:00:33,860 --> 00:00:35,380
they don't have the cleanest record at there.

16
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:35,940
However,

17
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:39,240
the fact remains these devices are very good.

18
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:40,575
If you're in the market for

19
00:00:40,575 --> 00:00:42,815
some of that thin and light with great performance,

20
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:44,360
this should be on the short list.

21
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:47,100
So, i'm just gonna jump into performance real quick

22
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:50,120
These are running Whiskey Lake CPUs.

23
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:51,480
They're quad core, they're fast

24
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:53,480
and for anyone considering an ultrabook,

25
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:55,020
they'll get the job done.

26
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:56,740
But they're also running nVidia GPUs

27
00:00:56,740 --> 00:00:57,780
and that's what makes these things special

28
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:00,520
cuz most ultrabooks that are thin and light like this

29
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:03,280
are usually running integrated graphics

30
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:05,320
These are running dedicated nVidia GPUs.

31
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:07,240
They're very similar in performance

32
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:09,000
despite having very different names

33
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:09,960
they're not gaming GPUs

34
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:11,520
but if you do wanna play some light games

35
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:12,480
they will work,

36
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:14,800
I'm still on the fence as value of these cards,

37
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:16,640
like, on one hand they're not super powerful,

38
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:19,600
of course, you can't do alot of graphically intensive stuff with it,

39
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:22,360
but, if you're looking for something that's thin and light

40
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:24,080
that does have graphical capabilities,

41
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:25,360
these are a perfect fit.

42
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:27,640
Now , I wanna talk about fans and thermals for a sec,

43
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:29,640
these have upgraded fans.

44
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:33,080
the 2018 models for both these devices had

45
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:35,080
kinda weak thermal performance,

46
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:38,320
they had loud fans, they had inappropriately sized fans,

47
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,240
these are better but hey're still not perfect.

48
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,680
The Matebook 13 are now running two fans,

49
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:43,360
instead of one,

50
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:45,080
but the Matebook X pro's still running one fan,

51
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:46,960
it's an improved fan, it's better

52
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:49,640
but, both of these devices

53
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:50,400
still run pretty loud on load

54
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:51,480
and when they're idling,

55
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:52,760
I feel like the fans come on more often

56
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:53,720
then I'd liked them to

57
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:56,320
maybe that's something can be fixed with software and

58
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:59,880
Huawei does put out software updates prettry frequently for their deivces

59
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:00,480
but

60
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:02,480
I just feel like these things should be quieter

61
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:03,760
than they're in their current state.

62
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:05,920
Now, the main difference between these two devices

63
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:07,120
is their displays.

64
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:10,320
this is running a 13 inch 1440p panel,

65
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:13,840
the X pro's higher res' 3K by 2K

66
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,715
and it's larger 14 inch panel

67
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:18,400
but the display on the Matebook X pro is

68
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:19,520
significantly brighter

69
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,000
I think for most people

70
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
they're going to be really drawn to this screen's brightness

71
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:22,960
and colors.

72
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:24,320
The Matebook 13's screen is already great,

73
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:27,400
it's just that the Matebook X pro's that much better.

74
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,560
In fact, if you're deciding between the two,

75
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:30,640
I really feel like you should just

76
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:32,360
figure out what type of screen you want

77
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:33,520
or need,

78
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:35,440
and then make your decision based on that

79
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:37,640
because it really is the fundamental difference

80
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:38,120
between the two.

81
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:40,600
the Matebook 13 ha a standard webcam up top,

82
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:43,200
but the X pro has the popup webcam

83
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,320
if you haven't seen this in the past,

84
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:46,480
they have a key that you can press

85
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:47,760
and the webcam pops up,

86
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,680
it's pretty cool, I don't think

87
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:52,240
it's a particularly great location like

88
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:53,720
when using it you can see your hands as you're typing,

89
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:55,720
but i think for most people

90
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:57,200
who don't use their webcams frequently,

91
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,040
this is a great lil' addition

92
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:00,680
like a kinda hidden webcam

93
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:01,960
that doesn't get in your way

94
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:05,080
and, the screen has a very thin bezel because of it.

95
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:06,280
the port selection is

96
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:08,320
relatively light on both these devices,

97
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:11,360
the Matebook 13 has two USB c

98
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,120
now there's a side supporting thunderbolt 3

99
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:16,160
and the left side can be used for charging

100
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:18,760
so they're port-light device for sure,

101
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:21,320
the X pro has an extra USB A

102
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:25,240
and 2 USB c ports support 4 lane thunderbolt 3.

103
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:27,960
the speakers on both of these laptops are very good.

104
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:30,120
the Matebook 13 has located at the bottom

105
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:33,400
but despite their not great location they sound really clean

106
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:36,800
the speakers on the X pro are definitely better.

107
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:37,680
There's two on the bottom

108
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:38,800
and there's two on the top

109
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:39,960
and they sound excellent.

110
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:42,000
they're seriously some of the best speakers

111
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:42,640
in the ultrabook market.

112
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:45,760
I will say they're comparable to Macbook's speakers which are

113
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:47,480
I'd say class-leading

114
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:49,360
These are on par with that.

115
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:50,160
AH, okay.

116
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:51,600
Keyboards.

117
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:54,200
These keyboards have obviously been inspired by

118
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:56,240
Macbook keyboards from the past.

119
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:57,400
and that's honestly a good thing

120
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:58,400
These are easy to get used to,

121
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59,600
it's got a good layout,

122
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:00,680
easy to type on,

123
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:02,680
I think most people use these keyboards and

124
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:04,740
find them comfortable to use fright away.

125
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:07,180
At the top of the keyboard is a fingerprint sensor

126
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:09,000
Both of these devices lets you

127
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,620
login to the device with Windows Hello.

128
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:14,100
and oh, on the Matebook X pro,

129
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:16,400
there is something called Huawei Connect,

130
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:18,600
I don't have the ability to use it because

131
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:20,140
I don't have a Huawei phone that supports it,

132
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:21,460
but if you have one, you can place that phone

133
00:04:21,460 --> 00:04:24,500
on the NFC sticker and it will transfer data from the phone.

134
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:26,040
and you're device which is pretty cool

135
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:29,400
Truthfully, I think it's a really cool and quite innovative

136
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:31,440
like if this is was an Apple feature

137
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,300
like people will go crazy for it,

138
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:35,700
it's just that Huawei phones that support that feature

139
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:37,020
aren't wide spread enough

140
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:39,280
to make this thing like super cool but i do think

141
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,260
it's a cool idea.

142
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:42,120
Um, oh trackpad.

143
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:43,260
their running Windows precision driver

144
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:45,700
you have good tracking, good gesture detection,

145
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:49,140
and the button mechanics on both of them are nice clean clicked

146
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:51,280
There does seem to be a little of a

147
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:52,340
quality control issue

148
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:54,060
I think both of these devices have a lil' bit of

149
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:55,420
play on the trackpad which

150
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:56,160
i wished wasn't there

151
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,900
but they exist

152
00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:01,140
Also other things that I'm not super fond of

153
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:04,660
the Matebook 13 only supports 8 gigs of ram

154
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:06,680
and it probably won't affect most people

155
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:09,800
I think taht 8 gigs are sufficient for lot of work flows

156
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:11,740
but you can't upgrade it to 16,

157
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:14,220
the  Matebook X pro and also the

158
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:16,140
14 inch version of this supports 16

159
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:18,440
but this only supports 8.

160
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,920
The hardware on these Matebooks is excellent.

161
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:22,060
there's no denying that

162
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:23,920
but the pricing is a lil' bit more than

163
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:24,520
what i thought would be.

164
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,060
this comes at $1,300,

165
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:28,060
this comes in at $1,900.

166
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:30,960
and that's both for the dedicated graphics versions

167
00:05:31,375 --> 00:05:34,285
that's on par with any of the premium

168
00:05:34,285 --> 00:05:35,780
Windows laptops on the mark right now

169
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:36,580
there is nothing wrong with that,

170
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:39,080
like these are clearly premium devices but

171
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:41,320
last year, this one in particular

172
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:43,220
the Matebook X pro was

173
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:45,760
it was like 20% cheaper than now

174
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:47,240
and I think it's gone to the point where

175
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:49,740
Huawei knows that their making good hardware

176
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:52,380
they know they have one the best laptops on the market

177
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:54,340
so they bumped up the price because they can

178
00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:57,260
the X pro costs more than the Razor Blade Stealth

179
00:05:57,260 --> 00:05:59,560
and that was already a very expensive device

180
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:01,920
The Matebook lineup has great build quality

181
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:03,820
the X pro does have slightly better

182
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:05,940
build quality it's a unibody design

183
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:07,340
so the panels are just a lil' tighter

184
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:08,860
but they're both well built.

185
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:11,860
Regards on people calling these clones of Apple's Macbooks

186
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:14,360
I can kinda understand where they're coming from

187
00:06:14,365 --> 00:06:17,125
they obviously inspired this design

188
00:06:17,125 --> 00:06:18,400
fomr Apple's Macbook lineup,

189
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,360
and even the color of the devices

190
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:23,385
like the grey unit they call it space grey

191
00:06:23,385 --> 00:06:24,560
they could have called it anything

192
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:25,940
they could've called it meteor grey,

193
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:26,960
rock grey,

194
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:29,140
storm grey but they went with space grey because

195
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:30,220
that's what Apple did

196
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:31,680
and that's what Huawei rolls,

197
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:34,595
But these devices are excellent

198
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:37,260
like they're just such good hardware that

199
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:39,355
You know, I didn't make this video to be like

200
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,060
hey, everyone should buy these devices.

201
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:41,620
I'm certainly not saying that

202
00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:43,620
but if you're in the market for

203
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:45,060
a thin and light ultrabook,

204
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:46,640
that has performance like this,

205
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:48,300
you should definitely look at them.

206
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:49,060
Because they're that good.
