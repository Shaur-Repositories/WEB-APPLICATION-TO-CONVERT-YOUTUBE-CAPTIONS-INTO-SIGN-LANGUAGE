2
00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:07,290
when Nvidia launches a new GPU for

3
00:00:05,550 --> 00:00:08,760
laptops they normally come up with their

4
00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:09,990
best stuff first the most expensive

5
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:12,030
stuff it's like the latest and greatest

6
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:14,460
and they try to convince people to buy

7
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:16,349
the whatever's newest right and then a

8
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:18,000
few months later they will come out with

9
00:00:16,349 --> 00:00:20,189
that kind of the mid-tier offerings of

10
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,919
that generation and right now in spring

11
00:00:20,189 --> 00:00:24,839
of 2019 we've seen invidious hand so we

12
00:00:22,919 --> 00:00:27,300
have a lot of options to choose from we

13
00:00:24,839 --> 00:00:30,239
have the older generation 10 series

14
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:32,850
stuff we have their 20 series r-tx like

15
00:00:30,239 --> 00:00:36,510
the prime like best of the best and then

16
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:38,219
we have their newest 1650 and 1660

17
00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:40,320
gaming laptops now if you're loaded and

18
00:00:38,219 --> 00:00:41,910
you have tons of money to burn then you

19
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:44,160
pick up a three or four thousand dollar

20
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:46,050
RTX laptop and you're good to go but for

21
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:47,670
most people you got to make a decision

22
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:50,730
as to which one to get so this video is

23
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:52,649
to kind of help you choose which one of

24
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:54,719
these would probably the best fit and I

25
00:00:52,649 --> 00:00:56,100
have a particular kind of combination I

26
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:59,160
think is the best value for your money

27
00:00:56,100 --> 00:01:02,609
right now so I made a video a few months

28
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:04,680
ago about how r-tx laptops were not a

29
00:01:02,609 --> 00:01:06,690
wise choice to make and months later

30
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:08,430
we're still in the same position I still

31
00:01:06,690 --> 00:01:10,560
don't recommend most people buying an RT

32
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:13,200
X gaming laptop because for one they're

33
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:15,540
super expensive too the technology

34
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:17,940
hasn't matured like it's been eight

35
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:19,940
months since r-tx has come out like the

36
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:22,350
technology was introduced publicly and

37
00:01:19,940 --> 00:01:23,970
there's like three or four playable

38
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:25,560
games that support our checks there's

39
00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:27,540
battlefield 5 which we've seen a lot of

40
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:29,310
and there's Tomb Raider and I think

41
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:30,690
there's a racing game point being it's

42
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:32,970
not a technology that's being quickly

43
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:34,800
adopted by developers and I don't blame

44
00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:36,960
them like if your game developer you

45
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:38,910
have to assign resources to support

46
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:40,650
ray-traced graphics right it's gonna

47
00:01:38,910 --> 00:01:42,300
take from other projects and stuff like

48
00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:43,650
that it's gonna cost money and you don't

49
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:44,880
be a company that's backing the wrong

50
00:01:43,650 --> 00:01:47,160
horse you'd want to be the guy that's

51
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:48,690
like hey we have a ray traced game but

52
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:50,730
the game isn't very good no one wants to

53
00:01:48,690 --> 00:01:53,160
be that developer so my position still

54
00:01:50,730 --> 00:01:55,440
stands when it comes to RTX laptops most

55
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:57,450
people should not be buying them still

56
00:01:55,440 --> 00:02:00,120
when it comes to the 10 series devices

57
00:01:57,450 --> 00:02:02,250
these are still good however the well is

58
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:04,770
drying up the stock levels for the good

59
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:06,750
GTX 10 series laptops is definitely

60
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:08,399
dropping so if you want to get one I'll

61
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:10,200
link some below as to devices that I

62
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:11,520
still think are quite good for the money

63
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:12,810
it's just that if you're going to do it

64
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,630
you probably want to do it sooner than

65
00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:16,750
later

66
00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:19,780
and lastly the new ones the 1650 and

67
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:21,550
1660 devices from Nvidia these GPS are

68
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:22,750
aimed at the entry to mid to your market

69
00:02:21,550 --> 00:02:24,610
so the devices are a little bit cheaper

70
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:27,580
but the one of interest to me is the

71
00:02:24,610 --> 00:02:29,110
1660 ti that performance is quite

72
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:31,000
similar to the 1070 max-q

73
00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:32,740
and because of the newer architecture

74
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,290
it's slightly more energy efficient as

75
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:37,660
just a better chip overall but there is

76
00:02:35,290 --> 00:02:40,840
one unique device made by Asus which is

77
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:44,290
running an AMD CPU and that 1660 Ti and

78
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:45,640
it goes for $1,100 it's the Zephyrus G

79
00:02:44,290 --> 00:02:47,110
I'm gonna be doing a review on that

80
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:49,240
pretty soon but because it's running an

81
00:02:47,110 --> 00:02:52,000
AMD CPU it's quite a bit cheaper than

82
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:54,370
devices that are based on Intel stuff um

83
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,830
okay here's the thing right now I'm

84
00:02:54,370 --> 00:02:58,180
using as my daily driver I really hate

85
00:02:56,830 --> 00:03:02,140
that word but the device I use most

86
00:02:58,180 --> 00:03:03,790
frequently is the razor blade from 2017

87
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:05,530
I'm still running a 1070 max-q even

88
00:03:03,790 --> 00:03:08,230
though I have access to a lot of laptops

89
00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:10,930
I'm someone that recognizes the value of

90
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:13,060
just using stuff that's really good from

91
00:03:10,930 --> 00:03:14,290
the past and I think this is the message

92
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:18,580
I want to convey to my audience right

93
00:03:14,290 --> 00:03:21,190
now this year both the companies Nvidia

94
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:22,180
and Intel are trying to push stuff on to

95
00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:25,270
consumers they're trying to sell us

96
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:27,700
stuff that we don't need right the stuff

97
00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:30,730
from 2018 was awesome superfast screens

98
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:32,500
six core CPUs 10 series GPUs this was

99
00:03:30,730 --> 00:03:35,260
seriously like the Golden Age of gaming

100
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:36,880
laptops and the new stuff is better but

101
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:38,500
keep in mind what games you're gonna

102
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:39,670
play what games you'd like to play and

103
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:40,870
then make a decision based on that

104
00:03:39,670 --> 00:03:43,270
because you can get some really good

105
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:45,010
stuff still in the 10 series laptops and

106
00:03:43,270 --> 00:03:48,100
if you're gonna buy one of the new ones

107
00:03:45,010 --> 00:03:50,140
I'd lean more towards the 1650 and 1660

108
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:52,390
devices because as cool as r-tx

109
00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:53,560
technology is the games just aren't

110
00:03:52,390 --> 00:03:54,580
there yet and I know some people are

111
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:57,670
like you know I want to get a

112
00:03:54,580 --> 00:04:00,430
future-proof laptop by the time RTX is

113
00:03:57,670 --> 00:04:02,860
super popular like get it then get your

114
00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:04,990
gaming device then because by that point

115
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:06,850
in time the 20 series laptops are gonna

116
00:04:04,990 --> 00:04:08,440
be pretty old okay hope you guys enjoyed

117
00:04:06,850 --> 00:04:09,010
this video thumbs we liked it subs if

118
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:11,670
you loved it

119
00:04:09,010 --> 00:04:11,670
see you guys next time
