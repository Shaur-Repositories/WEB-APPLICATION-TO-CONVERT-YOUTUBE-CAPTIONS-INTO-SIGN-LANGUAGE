1
00:00:03,020 --> 00:00:05,020
All right

2
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:08,720
Hey, how's it going Dave 2D here a couple days ago?

3
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:13,019
I went onto Twitter to ask people to ask me some questions for this [Q/A] video

4
00:00:13,019 --> 00:00:19,679
And I did it because truthfully super busy at work don't have time for a regular text video hence the filler Q/A video

5
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:21,839
I apologize if you're expecting a tech video this week

6
00:00:22,510 --> 00:00:27,239
[okay], first. What do you do for a living beside Youtube it's a little bit complicated

7
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:34,529
but the simpler answer is that I work at a company that does the engineering the architecture the development - construction of

8
00:00:35,079 --> 00:00:39,628
Medical buildings, so imagine a medical clinic those things are built from like step 0 through step

9
00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:43,379
10,000 we do all [of] them and one of those steps happens to be

10
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:49,110
Equipping them with tech and that's kind of how I got [into] this besides

11
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:52,829
Tech is there any other stuff that you'd like to make videos about and

12
00:00:53,379 --> 00:00:58,858
I would do the answer that'd [know] mostly because I [think] I'd be [pretty] terrible at making every other type of video you

13
00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:01,140
Do 2d game development - what have you made?

14
00:01:01,629 --> 00:01:06,029
I'm a little hesitant to tell you because it's terrible [okay]. I worked on several

15
00:01:06,850 --> 00:01:08,580
teams for game development

16
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:13,889
But the one game that I made that is like most personal to me because everything about it [was] like it was my game

17
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:17,879
Mechanic my game design it's a game called inject. It's available in the app store

18
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:22,919
It's only for ios. It's [a] terrible game don't purchase it please

19
00:01:23,590 --> 00:01:26,880
But it exists if you want to see how terrible it was you can take a look at it

20
00:01:26,909 --> 00:01:31,048
I might put a link to like the trailer down in the comments section or in the video description

21
00:01:31,990 --> 00:01:36,629
What do you use to [make] the animations in your videos I use after effects. There's no like easy way to do it

22
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:40,680
It's time consuming.I enjoy doing it. It's kind of like a cathartic like

23
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:44,099
Relaxing thing for me to just like draw the lines and stuff like that

24
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:50,100
But it's not a quick process by any means to use a laptop or desktop primarily I use almost

25
00:01:50,470 --> 00:01:55,439
exclusively laptops mostly because my work requires me to be pretty mobile and

26
00:01:56,409 --> 00:02:00,929
Laptops while you do that, how do you balance a Youtube channel work and personal life I?

27
00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:07,829
Don't I think I'm pretty bad at it. I sleep very little and that's probably like the easiest way to do it

28
00:02:07,829 --> 00:02:12,689
How do you spin laptops on the finger? How do you develop the skill? It's essentially like spinning

29
00:02:13,330 --> 00:02:15,820
A textbook it's unlike spinning a basketball

30
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:18,669
But the basketball [you] kind of use your other hand to keep the ball

31
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:25,629
Going with speed with a laptop or a textbook you have to keep the speed with the same spinning finger

32
00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:29,469
Are you related to Marques brown you guys have the same last name?

33
00:02:32,450 --> 00:02:37,630
Okay, we're both last names [wait]. Why do you use a Mac slash hackintosh instead of windows?

34
00:02:39,890 --> 00:02:44,679
The simple answer okay the true answer is that I am much more productive on a Mac

35
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:50,560
Simply because I can't predict around I can't play games on a mac as readily as I can on a good PC

36
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:53,619
Like I have very poor self control when it comes to playing game

37
00:02:53,620 --> 00:03:00,190
I will just sink hours into the game if I have access [to] a good computer when you have a good Mac

38
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:04,990
You can't play the games that I like to play hence. I use a Mac to Force myself to

39
00:03:05,570 --> 00:03:07,570
Curb my gaming habits

40
00:03:08,030 --> 00:03:13,119
Whatever do a behind the scenes laptop review. No those are really they would be super boring to watch. I assure you

41
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:15,940
Have you ever been to MalaySia?

42
00:03:16,190 --> 00:03:21,880
[yes], I have part of my family's from there, and I often go there for work, but yeah

43
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:25,839
I go there once in a while. What are three important tips you could give to a new?

44
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:32,799
Tech channel okay, I mentioned this in my first Q&A I don't remember exactly the points I gave them

45
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:34,900
But the one that comes to mind is

46
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:38,409
making content that you personally enjoy that you

47
00:03:38,989 --> 00:03:40,070
enjoy

48
00:03:40,070 --> 00:03:43,719
like creating and you enjoy watching because if you don't if you're just doing

49
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:46,689
Content because you think it's the right thing to do or you think it's popular

50
00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:51,190
It's going to come across people can smell that a mile away. It's just bad content

51
00:03:51,739 --> 00:03:55,359
Enjoy the process because seriously that's probably the most important thing about YouTube

52
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:58,360
other like tips

53
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:04,059
Clattering oh man. I'm not good [with] that stuff. Maybe something another thing that comes to mind

54
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:06,380
don't

55
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:10,779
Like try not to watch other people's content and try to replicate what they're doing

56
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:14,739
That's something that I think a lot of people are tempted to do because they see a successful challenge like hey

57
00:04:14,739 --> 00:04:18,759
I'll do what that guy is doing, but I'll do it. My [own] way do my spin on it

58
00:04:18,890 --> 00:04:25,359
It's a terrible way to do things you call yourself a content creator because you're a content creator. You should be creating things

59
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:33,069
And replicating I really think that I mean the more that you practice at making your own style the better

60
00:04:33,069 --> 00:04:35,199
You'll get at it. So make your own thing

61
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:37,490
Try not to bite

62
00:04:37,490 --> 00:04:40,780
What's your favorite watch character over [watch] Character [Road] [hogs]?

63
00:04:41,389 --> 00:04:46,839
Probably because he doesn't have he doesn't require like good twitching. He's just

64
00:04:47,389 --> 00:04:48,560
Yeah

65
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:52,750
because I have that aim non check item favorite non tech item that you own I

66
00:04:54,319 --> 00:04:56,319
Don't [know]

67
00:04:56,389 --> 00:05:00,519
Maybe my backpack that's really lame answer. I apologize

68
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:06,639
How do you keep things so clean did you place a lot of storage or deal with mentally minimally?

69
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:10,478
I throw out everything that I can't like the moment I open something

70
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,680
like a box

71
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:15,970
Immediately gets thrown out all the cables that I don't absolutely need get thrown out

72
00:05:15,970 --> 00:05:19,329
It's just I mean I'm terrible with keeping things

73
00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:24,280
I sometimes regret having thrown certain things out, but it just lets you have a cleaner space

74
00:05:25,009 --> 00:05:29,049
[XPs], 15 or the X360 15 XPs 15 for sure?

75
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:34,180
do I think each Eps will take off this year no mostly because

76
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:36,919
external gPUs

77
00:05:36,919 --> 00:05:41,619
the when they were announced the 10 series pascal and video cards had not come out and

78
00:05:41,930 --> 00:05:43,930
It kind of made a lot of sense at the time

79
00:05:44,029 --> 00:05:46,869
The 10th used cards are such a big jump up from the previous [generation]

80
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:51,370
And they're so similar to be like the laptop versions are so similar to the desktop versions

81
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:57,579
It's not really a compelling purchase. It's such an expensive like everything about it. Just doesn't work right now

82
00:05:57,650 --> 00:06:04,120
Maybe in the future, but right now eg gpus are too expensive and the performance isn't good [enough] to really warrant it for most people

83
00:06:05,630 --> 00:06:07,989
What's your daily schedule look like I?

84
00:06:09,289 --> 00:06:12,699
Work a lot like 6070 sometimes more 6070 hours

85
00:06:13,490 --> 00:06:14,500
for my regular work

86
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:18,039
So I try to devote maybe four to five hours of like shooting

87
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:22,899
With YouTube videos per week like so [2] hours [1] Day [2] hours a second day

88
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:28,150
I [never] give myself more than [2] days to shoot youtube videos and I shoot during my lunch break and stuff like that

89
00:06:28,150 --> 00:06:32,529
I'll edit videos at home at night, but I just don't have more time than that to shoot video

90
00:06:34,070 --> 00:06:39,439
The rest of my time is [spent] doing work and spending time with my family daily driver is currently using

91
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:43,189
Nexus not the nexus the pixel phone that shows how much I often use

92
00:06:43,190 --> 00:06:48,380
I actually use it [the] pixel and the iphone and I use the Macbook pro and the XPS 15

93
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:55,580
Occasionally the razor blade if it had 32 gigs of ram. I would use a razor blade more, but XPs 15 more often than not

94
00:06:57,510 --> 00:07:00,110
What's your education I went to university of Toronto

95
00:07:00,110 --> 00:07:00,690
[I]

96
00:07:00,690 --> 00:07:08,330
Studied a human bio like a life science kind of thing completely unrelated to what I do for work completely unrelated to the YouTube stuff

97
00:07:08,610 --> 00:07:10,610
But that's what I did

98
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:14,090
What's the best beginner camera your smartphone camera?

99
00:07:14,090 --> 00:07:20,449
You can make some amazing stuff with a smartphone camera, you completely don't need anything else more than that to start a YouTube channel

100
00:07:21,270 --> 00:07:24,439
Did you get a gh4 specifically for YouTube or something else?

101
00:07:25,170 --> 00:07:26,850
okay, I

102
00:07:26,850 --> 00:07:29,300
Actually yea, the Gh4 was my first camera

103
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:31,669
I actually borrowed that thing from my friend

104
00:07:31,670 --> 00:07:32,220
and

105
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:37,460
I used it for a very long time like a year and a half and then I broke it because I'm a terrible friend and

106
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:42,679
I actually pre-ordered the red the scarlet w before I broke it

107
00:07:43,170 --> 00:07:44,840
It just took so long for it to come

108
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:48,199
[I] had to purchase a like intermediary camera in between a

109
00:07:48,630 --> 00:07:50,400
Panasonic G7 that I used for a

110
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:56,509
couple months in between and then after that I went to the [scrub] w so it's kind of weird the scarlet Debbie is actually my

111
00:07:56,510 --> 00:07:58,760
Very first camera that I purchased

112
00:07:59,370 --> 00:08:00,900
just kind of

113
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:02,900
pick idiotic

114
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:08,240
What do I eat for breakfast? I've not much of a breakfast person? I'm a coffee person

115
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:12,319
Where are you from I am obviously

116
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:15,200
Asian, I'm like my dad is half

117
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:22,220
Chinese half malaysian my mom is half Chinese half burmese so that yeah, you can

118
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:28,040
Asian, I was born and raised in Canada though, so I was born in Toronto raised in Toronto, Canada

119
00:08:29,819 --> 00:08:35,508
What was I doing before being a full-time youtuber [I] would not consider myself a full-time youtuber at all

120
00:08:35,969 --> 00:08:40,818
Before [I] made youtube videos on the [side], I made 2d games on the side

121
00:08:43,169 --> 00:08:49,038
Pancakes or waffles waffles for sure like for sure mostly because waffles are more like

122
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:54,199
Anyone can make a pancake you make pancake mix and [just] make a pancake on any day

123
00:08:54,199 --> 00:08:58,519
But with a waffle you need like a waffle iron. You need like stuff to make it more awesome

124
00:08:58,519 --> 00:09:01,309
It's just like a fancier wall. It's basically a fancy pancake

125
00:09:02,339 --> 00:09:08,659
Favorite new game overwatch. I played that [a] lot classic game probably Zelda a [link] to the [past] on the Super Nintendo

126
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:16,220
Good memories there [specs] of your hackintosh, so it's bad things there. It's a 6700 K skylake

127
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:23,480
GtX 980 I don't love the reliability of it. It's fine for regular use, but I can't edit videos reliably on it

128
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:26,120
So I just tend not to use it as much as I would like to

129
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:33,169
Tim [Hortons] orders the Tim Hortons is like a coffee chain in Canada to milk one sweetener. That's like my go-to

130
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:37,938
What's the story behind the 2d in the channel name, so 2d is I guess?

131
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:44,329
My username on forums when I went on to [forums] like looking for how to do things for game development. It was Dave [2D]

132
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:51,319
What's the best way to learn video editing? Just do it man? You just got a giver and you'll get better over time

133
00:09:51,509 --> 00:09:56,899
what would be your perfect laptop so a laptop that was like thin and light that was somehow able to run a

134
00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:01,279
6 or Even 8 Core CPU like intel CPU would be awesome

135
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:03,919
It's not going to exist [anytime] soon at least I don't think it will

136
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:08,360
But that would be pretty perfect favorite youtubers that I watch that aren't in tech

137
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:12,319
I don't watch that much YouTube but the one guy that I watch relatively frequently is

138
00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:16,549
H3h3 his stuff is slap for everyone. I find it pretty funny

139
00:10:17,399 --> 00:10:19,399
Do you have a girlfriend I?

140
00:10:19,589 --> 00:10:23,958
Am married I have a wife does that count and have a kid I don't know if that counts as a girlfriend

141
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:30,469
How's the switch to red going for you? Was it the best decision? You've made also did you color the red symbol [teal] yourself?

142
00:10:30,990 --> 00:10:37,370
Okay, [Debrand] actually made that teal or blue logo thing and stuck it on for me. Which is awesome in terms of the workflow

143
00:10:37,399 --> 00:10:40,909
It's definitely slower than before. It's probably five maybe [10%]

144
00:10:41,410 --> 00:10:43,410
than my previous camera which was the Gh4

145
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:48,128
But it's so much more enjoyable to work with and the learning curve is just it's steep

146
00:10:48,129 --> 00:10:52,238
But [it's] very satisfying when you kind of figure stuff out as you go. Hope you guys enjoyed this video

147
00:10:52,239 --> 00:10:55,989
I gotta get back to work [some] to be liked it subs. We loved it. I'll see you guys next time
